Things that I want to implement:

Display:
- Need to find a way to make columns cleaner, it's kinda ugly right now
- also maybe consider putting bars or something to separate windows

Update:
- I'm pretty sure db.update() still doesn't work
  - update definitely does not work
- good way to test is create a dummy library I guess


jumping to current playing track
- it works but the algorithm is linear, which might be bad for longer playlists
  - O(lg(n)) alg is easy to implement (binary search), but O(1) is possible so go for that
    - probably just put another variable into player_disp that holds the current index (ugly...)

Bugs:
- there was a crash after pressing tab randomly, not sure what that is yet

- when entering a command, sometimes the cursor moves to the next line

- start up lags a little or something, first few inputs don't do anything
