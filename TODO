Things that I want to implement:

Update:
- I'm pretty sure db.update() still doesn't work
  - update definitely does not work
- good way to test is create a dummy library I guess


jumping to current playing track
- it works but the algorithm is linear, which might be bad for longer playlists
  - O(lg(n)) alg is easy to implement (binary search), but O(1) is possible so go for that
    - probably just put another variable into player_disp that holds the current index (ugly...)

Display:
- Need to find a way to make columns cleaner, it's kinda ugly right now
- also maybe consider putting bars or something to separate windows
  - I don't really care about this that much, still gonna keep it in case I have another change of heart

Menu_item:
- need to be consistent with how to use Menu_item and when to wrap or unwrap it

Bugs:
- there was a crash after pressing tab randomly, not sure what that is yet
  - maybe related, but a crash after just scrolling and doing stuff, it might be thread related?

- when entering a command, sometimes the cursor moves to the next line

- start up lags a little or something, first few inputs don't do anything

- resize doesn't instantly resize, idk why, gonna have to work this out

- after doing update-single, the display doesn't update, display shows corrected information after restart
