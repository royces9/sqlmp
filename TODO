Things that I want to implement:

jumpto:
- so you don't have to scroll through long playlists
- usage:
  :jumpto asdf

  will scroll down to the first instance of asdf in the column that is being used to sort by
  if there is no instance, do nothing, maybe add a way to jump to a specific tag as well?
  - eg
    :jumpto asdf artist

    jumps to first instance of asdf in artist column

Play count:
- increment play count when something is done playing, 

Display:
- Need to find a way to make columns cleaner, it's kinda ugly right now
- also maybe consider putting bars or something to separate windows

Update:
- I'm pretty sure db.update() still doesn't work
  - update definitely does not work
- good way to test is create a dummy library I guess

remote queue:
- because disp.getkey() blocks, the queue stuff isn't executed until AFTER a key is pressed and executed
- possible problems:
  - remote doesn't execute/changes aren't visible, until a key is pressed
  - the remote issues a command that becomes obsolute because the user
    inputs something before the remote's command can be executed
    - quick 'n' ez solution: execute AFTER the remote's stuff gets executed
      - problem is we run into the same issue, but the other way around

- possible solution?:
  - run getkey() without blocking, instead, check if there was an input, and push it onto the queue
  - even worse version: have another thread with a blocking getkey call, have it push onto the queue
    the queue can block with get() in the main loop
    - these don't seem to work with resize, because the resize event gets triggered, things draw on screen,
      then the screen actually gets resized, causing a crash


jumping to current playing track
- it works but the algorithm is linear, which might be bad for longer playlists
  - O(lg(n)) alg is easy to implement (binary search), but O(1) is possible so go for that
    - probably just put another variable into player_disp that holds the current index (ugly...)
- as of now, the screen jumps s.t. the top element is the current playing track, it's
  probably better to make it so that currently playing tracks near the bottom of the
  screen don't make the pl look empty

updating metadata of songs
- need a way to update song metadata singly

Bugs:
- when entering a command (with :), the cursor moves next to the current time playing

- sometimes the generator for playlist gets an out of bounds index, I'm not quite sure what the problem is yet

- during inorder playback, deleting a song sorted before the currently playing song will skip the next song
  - the index of all the songs after the deleted one jumps up one, so the index for the NEXT song
   is what the current song is during playback,
