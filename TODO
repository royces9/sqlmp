Things that I want to implement:

An easier way to add single files:
- Implement basic file explorer OR
- some sort of tab completion or something in the command window OR
- use tie in an already existing file explorer somehow?

Remote feature like cmus has:
- only really need a few things, like currently playing meta data and play pause maybe?

Play count:
- increment play count when something is done playing, 

Mute:
- maybe a mute option? i'll think about it, easy to implement so w/e right?

Display:
- Need to find a way to make columns cleaner, it's kinda ugly right now
- also maybe consider putting bars or something to separate windows

Update:
- I'm pretty sure db.update() still doesn't work
- good way to test is create a dummy library I guess



Bugs:
- when entering a command (with :), the cursor moves next to the current time playing
