Things that I want to implement:

Play count:
- increment play count when something is done playing, 

Mute:
- maybe a mute option? i'll think about it, easy to implement so w/e right?

Display:
- Need to find a way to make columns cleaner, it's kinda ugly right now
- also maybe consider putting bars or something to separate windows

Update:
- I'm pretty sure db.update() still doesn't work
- good way to test is create a dummy library I guess


Bugs:
- when entering a command (with :), the cursor moves next to the current time playing
