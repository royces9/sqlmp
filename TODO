Things that I want to implement:

Play count:
- increment play count when something is done playing, 

Display:
- Need to find a way to make columns cleaner, it's kinda ugly right now
- also maybe consider putting bars or something to separate windows

Update:
- I'm pretty sure db.update() still doesn't work
  - update definitely does not work
- good way to test is create a dummy library I guess


jumping to current playing track
- it works but the algorithm is linear, which might be bad for longer playlists
  - O(lg(n)) alg is easy to implement (binary search), but O(1) is possible so go for that
    - probably just put another variable into player_disp that holds the current index (ugly...)

updating metadata of songs
- need a way to update song metadata singly

text input idea
- expanding brain idea
  - toggle a flag that goes to the main loop and grab input from the main loop and jump back to the input function UNTIL enter or esc is hit
    holy moly its genius

Bugs:
- when entering a command (with :), the cursor moves next to the current time playing

- there was a crash after pressing tab randomly, not sure what that is yet
